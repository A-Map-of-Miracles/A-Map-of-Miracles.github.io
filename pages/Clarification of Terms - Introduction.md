- This is not a course in philosophical speculation, nor is it concerned with precise terminology. It is concerned only with [[Atonement]], or the correction of perception. The means of the Atonement is forgiveness. The structure of the "individual consciousness" is essentially irrelevant because it is a concept representing the "original error" or the "original sin." To study the error itself does not lead to correction, if you are indeed to succeed in overlooking the error. And it is just his process of over-looking at which the course aims.
